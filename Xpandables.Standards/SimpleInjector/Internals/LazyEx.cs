    // This class replaces the .NET's default Lazy<T> implementation. The behavior of the
    // ExecutionAndPublication mode of the default implementation is unsuited for use inside Simple Injector
    // because it will ensure that the factory is called just once, which means it caches any thrown exception.
    // That behavior is problematic because it can cause corruption of Simple Injector; for instance when, a
    // ThreadAbortException is thrown during the execution of the factory. See: #731.
    // This implementation behaves different to Lazy<T> in the following respects:
    // * It only supports reference types
    // * It does not allow the Value to be null.
    // * It only supports a single mode, which is a mix between ExecutionAndPublication and PublicationOnly.
    //   This mode has the following behavior:
    //   * It ensures the call to the factory is synchronized (like ExecutionAndPublication)
    //   * It ensures only one successful call to factory is made (like ExecutionAndPublication)
    //   * It will not cache any thrown exception and allow the factory to be called again (like PublicationOnly)
    // Simple Injector internally used Lazy<T>, especially with the ExecutionAndPublication mode, to ensure
    // that Singletons are guaranteed to be created just once. Replacing Lazy<T> will not per se cause this
    // guarantee to be broken, but now the underlying construct needs to make care that the guarantee isn't
    // broken. In the majority of cases, however, this loosening of constraints is perfectly fine.
